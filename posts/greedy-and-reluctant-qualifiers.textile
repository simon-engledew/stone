A common gotcha when using regular expressions occurs when using the (greedy) qualifiers + ? and *. These qualifiers will attempt to make the longest match they possibly can.

The regular expression:

<div class="code"><pre><code>/'(.*)'/</code></pre></div>

will successfully match and group the word <code>there</code> in <code>hello 'there'</code>, but will actually run on to the last single quote in the string <code>hello 'there' how are 'you'</code>, matching <code>there' how are 'you</code>.

One solution is to restrict the set of characters you are searching for with the greedy qualifier, thus ensuring the match will finish before hitting the terminating character:

<div class="code"><pre><code>/'([^']*)'/</code></pre></div>

In my opinion however, the more readable option is to turn the greedy qualifier into a _reluctant_ one:

<div class="code"><pre><code>/'(.*?)'/</code></pre></div>

By adding a ? to the qualifier the expression will try to match the minimum string that satisfies the expression.
