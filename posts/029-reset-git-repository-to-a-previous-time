As always, I find myself amazed by Git's sheer flexibility. While trying to reset a branch of my repository to 10 minutes before I had a happy accident, I found that you can use relative times in your commands:

<div class="code"><pre><code>git reset --hard master@{10.minutes.ago}

git diff master master@{1.month.ago}

git show master@{1.month.ago}:config.ru</code></pre></div>
