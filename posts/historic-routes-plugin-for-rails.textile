I've just started weaponizing a Ruby on Rails plugin which keeps track of a users' originating actions using their urls.


All you need to do is add a @*history@ parameter to any named route and the plugin handles the rest:

<div class="code"><pre><code class="ruby">map.feedback '*history/feedback'</code></pre></div>

All the state is stored in the URL, and any call to a <code>_url</code> or <code>_path</code> method will automatically validate and inject the current path. This creates a nice looking URL, DRY routes and a path that takes your users out the same way they went in:

<div class="code"><pre><code class="ruby"><%= link_to 'Cancel', previous_path %></code></pre></div>
