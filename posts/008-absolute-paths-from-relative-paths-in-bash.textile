There doesn't seem to be a nice, cross-platform way of deriving the absolute path from a relative one in Bash.
(@`readline -f .`@ works in Linux, but doesn't seem to work in OS X).

Here is a small program written in Python which does exactly that:

<div class="code"><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import os, sys
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print 'usage: %s <PATHS>' % sys.argv[0]
    raise SystemExit(1)
directory = os.path.dirname(sys.argv[1])
if len(sys.argv) > 2:
    directory = os.path.join(directory, *sys.argv[2:])
print os.path.abspath(directory)</code></pre></div>

Paste it into a file and @chmod a+x@ it and you have yourself a handy utility:

<div class="code"><pre><code>~/Projects $ abspath .
/Users/simon/Projects

~/Projects $ abspath ../
/Users/simon</code></pre></div>

I use it in a script called @server@ that starts various web-services. By starting the script with:

<div class="code"><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
directory=`abspath $0 ..`
cd $directory

...</code></pre></div>

you can now run it from anywhere on the file system. The script will @cd@ itself into the web service's working directory before kicking things off.
