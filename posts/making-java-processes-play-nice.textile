Looking around, it seems that there is no easy way to stop Java from eating all your system resources when running a particularly heavy-going task.

Thankfully my lovely colleague Ben made me aware of a helpful UNIX command called <code>nice</code>.

By prefixing <code>nice</code> to any command you can ask the scheduler to be a bit more kind, running the process at a slightly lower priority to ensure it doesn't starve other resources of CPU time:

<div class="code"><pre><code>nice java ExpensiveTask</code></pre></div>
